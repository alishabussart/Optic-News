						<span>Story</span>

						<p>Thousands of people took to the streets of Tempe this morning to watch some of the top athletes compete in the Ironman.And with this many people in one location, and with the recent terror attacks in Paris, Tempe Police were on high alert. Multiple law enforcement agencies, local and federal, were on hand making sure today’s event was a safe one. </p>

						<p>Tempe Police said planning for something like this takes months, and with what happened in Paris recently, security is top of mind.Lt. Scott Smith with Tempe Police says there are about 10,000 people participating in the event and roughly 3000 of those are competitors. </p>

						<p>"We have contingency plans in place, we have the appropriate resources to pretty much handle anything that happens," Smith said. Because of the recent terror attacks in Paris, security for the event was heightened. "We took pause and assessed what our event was and how we were planning for it; and we believe that we are prepared to respond to whatever arises, if it does," Smith said.   </p>

						<p>Smith says their security detail has learned a lot from what's happened in other tragedies around the world and plans accordingly. </p>

						<p>Today we spoke to race spectators who said they feel like the terrorists win when they don’t come to big events like this.</p>

						<p>"I think we need to show the world that we aren't afraid to come out and do these events and just live life, you know,” said Sean Comerford. “It's what you have to do."     </p>

						<p>The Ironman athletes have to swim 2.4 miles and bike 112 miles all before running a full marathon. </p>

						<p>As of now we have no reports of any security issues at the event.</p>
